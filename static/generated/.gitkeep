#  PUBLIC GENERATED ASSETS DIRECTORY
# ==========================================
#
# This directory is required to serve the final output files to the frontend.
# It stores:
# 1. MusicXML files (.xml) for sheet music rendering.
# 2. Piano Roll visualizations (.png).
#
# Context:
# These files are served via Flask's static file server. 
# They are the result of the ML pipeline and should be generated 
# fresh by the application, not version controlled.
#
# DO NOT DELETE THIS FOLDER.
# DO NOT COMMIT GENERATED ASSETS TO GITHUB.
